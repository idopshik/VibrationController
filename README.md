### Vibration-controller device (8-bit mcu based)

- lis-331DL SPI accelerometer mc beeng used
- clock and events ,connected to the time and vibrations can be bound
- can be multipurpose (this program state implements washing mashine swithing off in case of excessive vibrations)
- programmable level of threshold
- LED 7 segment indication (clock and vibration level in G grades)
- only two buttons with multiple events handling (long, double, double-long presses, etc)
- different melodies for different events. 
- robust,time-proven and bug-free state (several years of using device straight away)
